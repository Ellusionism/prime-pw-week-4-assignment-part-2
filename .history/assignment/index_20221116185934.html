  <h3 class="carInfo cont info text">I drive the white 2013 Kia Optima SXL below*. It's currently in the shop for engine repairs; luckily it was under warranty! Now all I need to do is buy some summer tires for this spring. I really like my car and hope I can continue to drive it for a long time.</h3>
